## Usage:
  
This PWA Text editor source code was provided to show the functionality of html webpack plugin and all the other accumlator/compiler/reader/writer files/packets that can be used to read/save/render data.

This is the *basic* functionality behind 'REACT' and a good example to be shown before the introduction of.

Showing the exhibition of loaders and how they compile data and then send information to a single source speeding up processing/display times.  This Text Editor itself demonstrates how locally stored data is faster and more user friendly.

The source code is just a simple example that can be used for an array of different ideas.

Here we are creating a *data entry window* aside from the browser, but, using the browser's built in capabilities available.  This *data entry window* application can be used with or without a connection.  Utilizing the required packet node files, together they gather text input from the *data entry window*, then write it to a manifest file, which then will be injected to the web browser's index file for display.
